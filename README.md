# Tableau Project
University Project

This university project tasked me with using Tableau to visualize data from The World Development Report 2013 containing statistics such as labor force participation, wage inequality, employment structure, youth unemployment, migration, and social cohesion. By transforming the raw data into interactive visualisations, this project uncovers trends and insights related to global employment patterns and workforce dynamics.

This project illustrates my proficiency in using Tableau to create clear, insightful visualizations from complex datasets.
